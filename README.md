# GalaxianClone
Galaxian clone made in C++ with Raylib

## Building
The program uses Raylib, and looks for raylib.lib in the raylib projects build directory.
This is to say build the raylib project before running the program.

## How to play
Move left and right using A and D, and fire with space.
Enemies fire down at you, and will occasionaly charge at you. Killing all enemies will spawn a new wave.
